# Unearthing Country Music - Beneath the Twang -
In this project, I explore the heart of Country music through a curated playlist of 200 songs spanning the years 1949 to 2024 featuring 50 artists, applying topic modeling to uncover rich narratives, and explore what lies beneath the twang.

Focusing on themes such as Love, Small-Town Life, Freedom, and Independence, I examine how motifs have intertwined and shifted as the genre evolves over time and across generations of performers.

My project highlights my experience with the culturally and historically significant voices of Country artists. I invite listeners to engage more deeply with the enduring legacy of this uniquely Americana sound.

# Latest Update:
I have migrated data, images, and the latest code that I am using. 
I am beginning to categorize words with hopes of using this categorization to highlight themes in featured songs.
