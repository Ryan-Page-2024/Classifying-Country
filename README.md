# Unearthing Country Music - Beneath the Twang
In this project, I explore the heart of Country music through a curated playlist of 200 songs spanning the years 1949 to 2024 featuring 50 artists, applying natural language processing techniques to explore what lies beneath the twang.

Focusing on 20 themes such as Love, Conflict, and Emotion, I examined how motifs have intertwined and shifted as the genre continues to evolve over time and across generations of performers.

My project highlights my experience with the culturally and historically significant voices of Country artists. I invite listeners to engage more deeply with the enduring legacy of this uniquely Americana sound.
